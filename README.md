Hi Unjars (short for unjargoners),<br>
Welcome aboard!<br>
Hope you are coming over from one of my [technical-nuts](http://blog.balajeetm.com/blog/2017/02/21/technical-nuts/) in my [blog](http://blog.balajeetm.com/).

For people who are what a technical nut is..<br>
Well, a t-nut is a short hand for a technical-nut. Any exiciting problem which requires a logical approach.<br>
For the details jump over to [t-nut](http://blog.balajeetm.com/blog/2017/02/21/technical-nuts/) and [cracking a t-nut](http://blog.balajeetm.com/blog/2017/03/08/cracking-a-tnut/)

## What's this repo?

This repo hosts the solutions for few programming t-nuts we encounter and address in my [blog](http://blog.balajeetm.com/)<br>

## How to use this repo

This repo contains a [maven](http://blog.balajeetm.com/blog/2017/02/14/why-maven/) based [spring boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) and [json-mystique](http://github.balajeetm.com/json-mystique) oriented web application with embedded servlet container.<br>
